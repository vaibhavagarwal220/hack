<h2>first and second</h2><h5>Problem Code:first</h5><br><p>Nikhil's slogan has won the contest conducted by Drongo Airlines and he is entitled to a free ticket between any two destinations served by the airline. All cities served by Drongo Airlines can be reached from each other by some sequence of connecting flights. Nikhil is allowed to take as many connecting flights as needed, but he must take the cheapest route between his chosen destinations.</p><br><h4>Input Format:</h4><br><p>Line 1 : Two space-separated integers, C and F . C is the number of cities on the network, numbered 1, 2, . . . , C. F is the number of pairs of cities connected by a direct flight.
Lines 2 to F + 1 : Each line describes one direct flight between a pair of cities and consists of three integers, x, y and p, where x and y are the two cities connected by this flight and p is the price of this
</p><h4>Output Format</h4><p>The output consists of a single integer, the maximum cost among the cheapest routes between all pairs of cities across the airline's network.

</p><br><h4>Constraints:</h4><p>The testdata is grouped into three subtasks. In all subtasks, 2 &#8804; C &#8804; 230 and 1 &#8804; F &#8804; 23665. In addition, each subtask has the following constraints on the inputs.

Subtask 1 (20 marks) : F = C &#8722; 1 (that is, the airline network is a tree) and p = 1 for each direct flight.
Subtask 2 (30 marks) : There is no constraint on the shape of the network, but for each direct flight, p = 1.
Subtask 3 (50 marks) : There is no constraint on the shape of the network, but for each direct flight, 0 &#8804; p &#8804; 105.
